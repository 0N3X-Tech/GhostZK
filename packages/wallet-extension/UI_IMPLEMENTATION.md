# GhostZK Wallet Extension UI Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the GhostZK wallet extension user interface, including architecture, components, state management, and transaction flows.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: UI library for building the component-based interface
- **Redux**: State management with action-based architecture
- **Material-UI**: Component framework for consistent styling
- **React Router**: Navigation between wallet screens
- **WebAssembly**: Integration with Aleo proof system via the proof-engine package

## Architecture

The GhostZK wallet extension follows a layered architecture:

1. **UI Layer**: React components and screens
2. **State Management Layer**: Redux for centralized state
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic and integration
4. **Core Layer**: Cryptographic operations via WASM bindings

```

## State Management

The Redux store is organized into several slices:

1. **wallet**: Core wallet state (initialization, unlocking, accounts)
2. **accounts**: Account balances and tokens
3. **transactions**: Transaction history and status
4. **network**: Network settings and connectivity
5. **settings**: User preferences
6. **dapp**: dApp connections and permissions

Each slice maintains its specific state and implements reducers for handling its actions. The redux-persist library maintains state across sessions.

## Main UI Components

### Pages

1. **Welcome**: Initial screen for new users
2. **CreateWallet**: Wallet creation flow
3. **ImportWallet**: Restoration from mnemonic
4. **Dashboard**: Main wallet interface showing balances and transactions
5. **Send**: Transaction creation interface
6. **Receive**: Address display for receiving funds
7. **Settings**: User preferences management
8. **Unlock**: Password entry for wallet access
9. **ConnectDApp**: DApp connection approval
10. **TransactionConfirm**: Transaction review and approval

### Core Components

1. **LoadingScreen**: Displayed during initialization
2. **Navigation**: Bottom navigation bar
3. **AccountSelector**: Choose between multiple accounts
4. **TransactionList**: Display transaction history
5. **BalanceCard**: Shows public and private balances
6. **AddressCopy**: Address display with copy function
7. **ProofProgress**: Progress indicator during proof generation

## User Flows

1. **Wallet Creation/Import**:
   - Welcome → CreateWallet/ImportWallet → Dashboard

2. **Unlock Flow**:
   - Unlock → Dashboard

3. **Send Transaction**:
   - Dashboard → Send → (ProofGeneration) → TransactionConfirm → Dashboard

4. **DApp Connection**:
   - External Request → ConnectDApp → Dashboard

## Privacy Features

1. **Balance Hiding**: Option to hide balances on screen
2. **Privacy Level Selection**: Standard, High, Maximum privacy modes
3. **Auto-Lock**: Automatic locking after inactivity
4. **Shielded Operations**: Support for both public and private transactions

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Storage**: Private keys and mnemonics are encrypted at rest
2. **Password Requirements**: For wallet access and transactions
3. **Auto-Lock**: Session timeout after inactivity
4. **Permissions Model**: Granular permissions for DApp connections

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Transaction Flows**: Implement the Send and Receive pages
2. **Add DApp Connector**: Implement the browser integration for dApp connections
3. **Implement Settings Page**: Complete user preference controls
4. **Create Account Management**: Allow creation of multiple accounts
5. **Implement Address Book**: Save and manage recipient addresses
6. **Add Advanced Features**: Import/export keys, view private records
7. **Add Localization**: Support multiple languages
8. **Add Unit Tests**: Test core components and state logic
9. **Add E2E Tests**: Test complete user flows
