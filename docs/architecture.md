# GhostZK Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the GhostZK system architecture, explaining how different components interact to create a privacy-preserving wallet and token protocol on Aleo.

## System Architecture

GhostZK consists of several interconnected components that work together to provide private token transactions, staking, and wallet functionality:

## Component Details

### 1. Proof Engine

**Purpose**: Generates and verifies zero-knowledge proofs for Aleo transactions.

**Key Features**:
- WebAssembly (WASM) bindings to the snarkVM
- Proof generation for private transactions
- Verification of transaction proofs
- Account key management

**Tech Stack**:
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Rust/WASM
- snarkVM integration

### 2. Token Protocol

**Purpose**: Implements the privacy-preserving token contract with staking capabilities.

**Key Features**:
- Private and public token transfers
- Staking and rewards distribution
- Token minting and burning
- Shield/unshield operations (private ↔ public)

**Tech Stack**:
- Leo programming language
- Aleo instructions

### 3. Relayer

**Purpose**: Enables gasless transactions by relaying them to the Aleo network.

**Key Features**:
- Meta-transaction support
- Fee subsidization
- Transaction monitoring
- API for client applications

**Tech Stack**:
- Node.js/Express
- TypeScript
- Aleo SDK

### 4. Bridge

**Purpose**: Connects the Aleo network with other blockchain networks.

**Key Features**:
- Cross-chain token transfers
- State synchronization
- Proof verification across chains

**Tech Stack**:
- TypeScript
- Smart contracts for target chains
- Cross-chain messaging protocols

### 5. Wallet UI (Extension and Mobile)

**Purpose**: User interface for interacting with the GhostZK protocol.

**Key Features**:
- Key management
- Transaction creation and monitoring
- Staking interface
- Account dashboard

**Tech Stack**:
- React/TypeScript (Extension)
- React Native (Mobile)
- Browser extension APIs

## Data Flow

1. **Transaction Creation**:
   - User initiates a transaction through the Wallet UI
   - Proof Engine generates necessary zero-knowledge proofs
   - Transaction is signed with the user's private key

2. **Transaction Submission**:
   - If user pays fees: Transaction is submitted directly to the Aleo network
   - If gasless: Transaction is submitted to the Relayer service

3. **Transaction Processing**:
   - Relayer validates the transaction and submits it to the Aleo network
   - Transaction is processed by the Token Protocol on-chain
   - Confirmation is sent back to the Wallet UI

4. **Cross-Chain Operations**:
   - Bridge monitors events on both chains
   - When cross-chain transfer is initiated, Bridge locks tokens on source chain
   - Bridge mints/releases tokens on destination chain

## Security Considerations

- **Privacy**: All private transactions generate zero-knowledge proofs to protect user data
- **Key Management**: Private keys never leave user devices
- **Relayer Security**: Transaction signing ensures relayers cannot modify transaction content
- **Bridge Security**: Multi-signature validation and proof verification for cross-chain operations

## Future Extensions

- **DAO Governance**: Decentralized governance for protocol parameters
- **Layer 2 Scaling**: Off-chain computation for improved scalability
- **Additional Privacy Features**: Mixing services and enhanced privacy options
